**Overview**

This project involves analyzing and classifying noisy audio signals. The analysis focuses on the heartbeat dataset, which contains normal and abnormal heartbeats recordings. The goal is to explore various signal-processing techniques to extract meaningful insights and determine suitable features for classification.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset consists of two folders:
- Train: Contains labelled samples of normal and abnormal heartbeats.
- Test: Contains unseen samples for validation.

**Sampling Rate**

Heartbeats dataset: 44.1 kHz

**Signal Processing Techniques Used**

The following signal-processing methods were applied to analyze the dataset:

1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
2. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
3. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
