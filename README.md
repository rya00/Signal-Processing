**Overview**
This project involves analyzing and classifying noisy audio signals. The analysis focuses on the heartbeat dataset, which contains recordings of normal and abnormal heartbeats. The goal is to explore various signal processing techniques to extract meaningful insights and determine suitable features for classification.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset is provided in a ZIP file on the module's Blackboard site. It consists of two folders:
- Train: Contains labeled samples of normal and abnormal heartbeats.
- Test: Contains unseen samples for validation.

**Sampling Rate**
Heartbeats dataset: 44.1 kHz

**Signal Processing Techniques Used**
The following signal processing methods were applied to analyze the dataset:

1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
2. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
3. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
